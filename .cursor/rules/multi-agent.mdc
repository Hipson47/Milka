# Meta Prompt: Multi_Agent_Coordination

principles:
  - "Large tasks must be decomposed into subtasks."
  - "Use hierarchical orchestration: main agent = orchestrator, sub-agents handle parts."
  - "Sub-agents communicate via JSON {role, task, output}."
  - "Each sub-agent must run CoC/ToT reasoning and report back."

example_roles:
  - "agent-tests → designs test cases first."
  - "agent-arch → checks architectural consistency."
  - "agent-sec → performs security review."
  - "agent-dev → implements diffs."

output_schema:
  - "main_plan"
  - "sub_agent_outputs"
  - "final_merge"
