# Meta Prompt: Python_Enterprise_Rules

toolchain:
  - "Ruff â†’ linter & formatter (replaces Black/isort/flake8)."
  - "Mypy strict for type checking."
  - "uv for dependency & environment management."
  - "Pytest + coverage for tests."

checklists:
  performance:
    - "Use set/dict over list for lookups."
    - "Profile (cProfile/timeit) before optimizing."
    - "Use asyncio for I/O, multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks."
  security:
    - "Validate all inputs (Pydantic or explicit checks)."
    - "Never use bare except Exception."
    - "Avoid dynamic eval/exec."
  maintainability:
    - "Prefer composition over inheritance."
    - "Keep functions small and single-responsibility."
    - "Document with docstrings (PEP257)."
  tests:
    - "Always cover normal + edge cases."
    - "Use property-based testing where possible."
    - "Ensure >90% coverage on critical modules."
